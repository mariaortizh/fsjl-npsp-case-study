# From Chaos to Clarity
**Salesforce NPSP Implementation for Foundations**

**TL;DR:** Implemented Salesforce Nonprofit Success Pack (NPSP) to centralize donor and campaign management. Data anonymized for portfolio purposes.

## Project Overview
- Role: Salesforce Analyst / Implementer 
- Tech Stack: Salesforce NPSP · DataLoader · SQL · R · Tableau

## Problem
The donor database was scattered across exports and manual records, resulting in many duplicates and no consolidated reporting.

## Solution (Key Steps)
1. Design and model NPSP objects  
2. Data migration (CSV → DataLoader)  
3. Deduplication and data cleaning (SQL / R)  
4. Automation and reporting setup  
5. Training and launch

## Results (Example Outcomes)
- Automated annual reports  
- Consolidated and segmented donor base  
- Improved donor retention through targeted campaigns
